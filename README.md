# INSAID Student Dashboard Features

## üöÄ Executive Summary
This project is part of my journey to **enhance my product management skills** by developing a **communication and networking dashboard** for INSAID students. By identifying pain points and proposing innovative features, I‚Äôm applying critical PM skills like **problem identification**, **feature prioritization**, **creating wireframes** and **user-centric design**.

This project is an initiative to design a **communication and networking dashboard** for INSAID students, focusing on students interested in **Data Science** and **Product Management**. The dashboard is intended to be a one-stop solution where students can **connect with peers**, **access valuable resources**, and **advance their careers** by building meaningful relationships. It addresses the need to move away from third-party platforms like WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Telegram by providing superior features and networking capabilities.

## üéØ Problem Statement
Students currently rely on third-party apps and websites to interact with their peers, build networks, and access learning materials. This leads to fragmented communication and a lack of cohesive networking within the INSAID student community.

## üåü Goals
- **Provide a centralized platform** for students to access important information and build networks with like-minded individuals.
- Enable seamless interaction and collaboration among students interested in **Data Science** and **Product Management**.
- Develop a portal that simplifies access to resources such as **blogs**, **videos**, **courses**, and **chat options** to facilitate learning and career advancement.

## üìê Hypothesis & Feature Overview
This project focuses on creating a **communication dashboard** for students interested in Data Science and Product Management. It comprises **five wireframes**, each illustrating different features and purposes to collectively address the problem statement. The dashboard is accessible from the **Network Forum** on the INSAID website.

### Wireframe 1: The Network Forum
<ins>**Feature**</ins>: Choose between **Data Science** and **Product Management** to access tailored resources and networks.
- This will enable the students to decide between the two mentioned fields and take them to their respective pages.
- In this way it would be easier to get the information in the most precise manner.

### Wireframe 2: The Home Page (Product Management Example)
<ins>**Feature**</ins>: Access various sections like **Blogs**, **Posts**, **Newsletters**, **Books**, and **Videos**.
- On the left sidebar the user can select between the above mentioned options to choose between the field of interest.
- This section contains the latest and most trending information about the topic.
- The default page is Blogs and the user can navigate to other sections or pages by clicking on the respective text.
- The idea is to provide various links, documents, video links(including documentaries, youtube videos, etc.), book links, posts, etc. of the respective topics at a single place. This makes student‚Äôs work easy and they don‚Äôt have to spend time on finding resources.

<ins>**Feature**</ins>: Feature to **share**, **like** or **dislike** a post.
- This wireframe contains blogs. Users can share the post with their peers if they find something interesting.

<ins>**Feature**</ins>: The second taskbar contains the **Search** feature. It further has options to choose among **People**, **Courses** and **Chat**.
- With the help of the search feature, students can easily find what they are looking for by typing some keywords.
- On selecting ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô, it will redirect the user to the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô page which is explained in the 3rd wireframe.
- On selecting ‚ÄòCourses‚Äô, it will redirect the user to the ‚ÄòCourses‚Äô page which is explained in the 4th wireframe.
- On selecting ‚ÄòChat‚Äô, it will redirect the user to the ‚ÄòChat‚Äô page which is explained in the 5th wireframe.

## üí° Vision Narrative
The main idea is to provide a **one stop solution** to **networking** and **connecting** with the people sharing similar interests. Come up with a solution so that students don‚Äôt have to rely on third party apps/websites such as WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Telegram in particular.

To get the **X-factor** out of our product we need to deliver something that the above mentioned companies are not providing or lacking. For this we should focus our attention on the drawbacks of these networking platforms.

WhatsApp is infamous for bad or poor quality of photos and videos sent or uploaded. We should ensure that the quality is not degraded in our portal. It also doesn‚Äôt allow files >16 MB to be sent. We have to make it accessible to share files >16 MB.

LinkedIn has a feature of restricted search. It doesn‚Äôt allow a user to search endlessly and instead has a cap on its search number. Thereby prompting the user to get their premium account. We should not keep any such restrictions on the search. At the same time we should not be biased with the students who have enrolled in the INSAID courses as well. This will increase the popularity of our website and students will get what they are looking for without any hassle. Apart from this once a student has logged into our website, it will enable the fellow students to chat with them and in this way they don‚Äôt have to wait for the people to accept their connection requests unlike LinkedIn users.

Telegram is famous for sharing large files and many groups that are available on it. They however have some files that are corrupted and some that are not downloadable. We must ensure that this doesn‚Äôt happen on our website.

## üìä Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Difficulty in uploading large files.
- **Mitigation**: Provide the option to share large files through Google Drive links.
